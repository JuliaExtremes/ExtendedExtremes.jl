# ExtendedExtremes Package

*[ExtendedExtremes.jl](https://github.com/houton199/ExtendedExtremes.jl)* provides a collection of extended Generalized Pareto distributions (EGPD) and related functions. In particular, the extended generalized Pareto families proposed in Naveau et al. (2016) and related methods are implemented, such as:

* Sampling from distributions
* Probability density functions (pdf) and their logarithm (logpdf)
* Cumulative distribution functions (cdf) and their logarithm (logcdf)
* Maximum likelihood estimation and Censored Maximum likelihood estimation
* Bayesian information criterion (BIC) calculation
* Diagnostic plots for assessing model accuracy
